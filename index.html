          <h2 style="color: wheat;">About Me</h2>
          <p>I am a student athlete who aims to compete on a higher level, <br> but I am also a student who prioritizes my study to have a better future.</p>

            <h2 style="color: wheat;">My Journey</h2>
            <p>As a student, I'm pretty average in most things. When it came time to pick a major for college, 
                <br>I landed on computer science. It wasn't a burning passion that drove me there: it was more about my friends who were into it too.
                 <br>Plus, I was a bit unsure about what I really wanted to do. <br> <br>

                As I got into my courses, I found myself kind of liking it. The problem-solving aspect was cool, <br>
                and I enjoyed tackling coding challenges. But there were times when I wondered if I was cut out for it. <br>
                <br>
                Despite my doubts, I stuck with it. I figured if I put in the effort, maybe I could make something of it. <br>
                I also got involved in other stuff outside of classes to round out my skills.
                <br>
                Now, I'm just hoping to keep at it and make it through to graduation. <br> I know it's not going to be easy, but I'm determined to give it my best shot.</p>
